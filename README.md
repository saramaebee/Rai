Discord bot for Discord language servers (Python).  Some key features: 
- Extensive logging of joins, leaves, bans, deletes, edits, reaction removes, and invites that people use to join a server
- A report room for users to make either anonymous reports to mods or enter a mod report chat room to discuss an issue.  Designed to eliminate the need for private messages completely from mod business.  
- A smart message prune/clear command which takes a message ID as input so you don't have to count messages
- Configurable reaction requirement to enter a server
- Super watchlist for when you have raiders who are repeatedly making accounts and spamming gore/porn/etc.
- A questions module to manage the questions queue of a server.  Mainly, for people who ask hard questions that get swept away in the channel, this module will help them make sure their question eventually gets answered.
- Options module for easy configuration of options
- Unlimited duration timed mutes and bans.
- Stats module for showing most active users in the server and per channel for the last month.

Bot is currently semi-private, message me on Discord if you want to use the bot (some users might be able to get an invite link by messaging `;invite` to Rai)

## Admin Commands
The commands in this module are only usable by users with either the `Administrator` privelege in a server, or if they have the mod role set in the next command.  **Most of these commands can be manipulated easier by typing `;options` and using the menu that comes up.**

#### Setting the mod channel
Important messages from the bot will go here.  This channel doesn't have to actually be your mod channel, just in the channel you want important notifications to go, type:
` **`;set_mod_channel`** Sets the current channel as the mod channel

#### Setting the mod role  
- **`;set_mod_role [role name]`** Sets the mod role for the server.  Type the name of the role exactly in [role name].
- **`;set_submod_role [role name]`** If you want to optionally allow a secondary role to be able to mute users, use this.  Otherwise, `;mute` will default to the main mod role.

#### Setting the submod role
This is an optional feature.  Submods can 1) ban users within one hour of them joining (for trolls spamming porn or something when there are no mods online), 2) mute users, 3) delete messages using a special command, and the log of the message will be left in the submod channel, and 4) pin messages using a special command.
` **`;set_submod_channel`** Sets the current channel as the submod channel

#### Setting the submod role  
- **`;set_submod_role [role name]`** Sets the mod role for the server.  Type the name of the role exactly in [role name].
  
#### Setting a custom prefix
- **`;set_prefix [prefix]`** Sets a custom prefix, for example, `;set_prefix !`
  - **`<prefix>set_prefix reset`** Resets the prefix to `;`
  
#### Ban/Mute/Warning + Modlog
- **`;modlog|warnlog [user]`** Views the modlog for a user.  This contains all incidents of them being warned or muted, and is helpful for times when they ask "What did I do?!?!? You never warned me!!"  Use silent warnings as a form of logging small incidents.
- **`;warnlog delete|del <user> <index>`** Deletes an entry from someone's warnlog.  Index refers to the number in the list when you call their `;warnlog`.  Example: `;warnlog delete 202995638860906496 2`.
- **`;warnlog edit|reason <user> <index> <reason>`** Edits the reason for an entry.  Index refers to the number in the list when you call their `;warnlog`.  You can also substitute `;warnlog reason` --> `;reason`.  Example: `;reason 202995638860906496 2 Trolling in voice`.
- **`;ban [time] <user> [reason]`** Bans a user for an optional amount of time with an optional reason.  Examples:
  - `;ban @Ryry013` Bans me indefinitely.  
  - `;ban 1d2h @Ryry013` Bans me for 1 day and 2 hours.
  ` `;ban @Ryry013 for being mean` Bans me indefinitely for being mean.
- **`;mute [time] <user>`** Mutes a user from all text and voice chat.  Similar usage to the above `;ban` command.
- **`;warn [user] <reason> <-s>`** Warns a user and sends them a PM.  Add `-s` into the reason to make it not send the PM (makes it silent).  Use this for either warning the user when they've done something, or use the silent warnings to log incidents 
  
#### Captcha to enter a server
Sets up a requirement to react to a message with a checkmark to enter a server / get a role.  Follow these steps:
1) First, do `;captcha toggle` to setup the module
2) Then, do `;captcha set_channel` in the channel you want to activate it in.
3) Then, do `;captcha set_role <role name>` to set the role you wish to add upon them captchaing.
4) Finally, do `;captcha post_message` to post the message people will react to.
  
#### Clear/prune messages
**`;clear [number of messages] (user) (message_id)`** *(aliases `;purge`, `;prune`)* A clear/prune command with LOTS of different ways to use it.  For a number of messages above 100, the bot will ask for a confirmation before starting the deleting.  

The `user` field can be an ID, nickname, username, or mention.  It will only delete messages from that user.  

The `message_id`, if specified, will start a prune that deletes all messages past the specified message.  See the following examples.

Typical usage:  
- **`;clear 50`** Clears the last 50 messages in the channel  
- **`;clear 50 USER_ID`** In the last 50 messages in the channel, deletes all messages from specified user.  
- **`;clear 50 Ryry013`** You can also search by username/nickname.  This is risky because the bot might find the wrong person.  
- **`;clear 50 USER_ID MESSAGE_ID`** Deletes all messages from a specified user that also fall after the specified message (The bot will delete 50 messages or all messages below the specified message, whichever is *less*)

Special syntax:  
- **`;clear MESSAGE_ID`** A syntax where you only specify a message ID.  It will default to a max of 100 messages at the most, and it will delete all messages from all users past the specified message id.

#### Report room
A feature that allows users to either make an anonymous report to the mods, or enter a special report room to have a conversation with the mods.  This feature was designed to eliminate the need for PMs in moderation.  Further detail will be written later/is written on my testing server.  For now, how to setup:
1) First, type `;report setup` in the channel you want to be the report room. Set the permissions on that channel so that `@everyone` can not view messages nor channel history. 
2) Make sure you have a mod channel set with `;set_mod_channel` and a mod role set with `;set_mod_role`
3) Type `;report` in a channel to test it all out.

Other commands:
- **`;report check_waiting_list`** Checks who is on the waiting list for the report room
- **`;report clear_waiting_list`** Clears the waiting list
- **`;report [USER / ID]`** Pulls a user into the report room if you want to ask them questions about something.  It is recommended to tell the user you will do this before you do it.
- **`;report reset`** If something bugs out with the report room, use this to reset it.  Make sure to also manually reset the permission overrides of the channel for the last user to have been in the room.
- **`;report_room_ping`** Enable/disable a `@here` ping when someone joins the report room.
- **`;report_anonymous_ping`** Enable/disable a `@here` ping when someone makes an anonymous report.

## Logging
Part of the admin commands, but deserves it's own section.  

There's a lot of logging that can be done, and the setup for all of them are pretty much all referring to the same code, so they're all the same.

The things you can log are:
- Deleted / edited messages (`;deletes`, `;edits`)
- Joins / leaves (`;welcomes`/`;joins`, `;leaves`)
  - Detection of which invite link a user used to join the server (`;invites`)
  - Readdition of roles to users who have left the server before and rejoin (`;readd_roles`)
- Nickname / username changes (`;nicknames`)
- Deleted reactions (so users can't react an insult and then clear it) (`;reactions`)
- Kicks / bans (`;kicks`, `;bans`)

Each module has a module name listed above in parenthesis (for example, "delete" for deleted messages logging), and can be either singular or plural to work (`;delete` and `;deletes` are the same and both work).

To toggle a module, just type the module name with the command prefix (example: `;deletes`)

To set the channel that the logging gets posted in, type the name of the module, then "set" (example: `;deletes set`)

For examples/screenshots of all the loggings, try it yourself or see my testing server.

## Questions
This module helps streamline the question asking process.  Mainly, for people who ask hard questions that get swept away in the channel, this module will help them make sure their question eventually gets answered.  

__To setup__  
Go to your questions channel and type `;question setup`.  You should be able to do this for multiple channels.

__To ask your own question__  
`;question <Title for your question>` (alias `;q`)  
The bot will react with a number telling you the `Question ID`.  
Example: `;q What is 2+2?`

__To mark someone else's comment as a question for them__  
`;question <the question's message ID> [optional title]`  
Cite the message ID of the original question
Example: `;q 553582103464378368``

__To mark a question as answered__
`;question answer <Question ID>` (alias `;q a`)  
Type this after enough answers have been given to consider the question answered

Same as above, but add the message ID to the end.  
`;question answer <Question ID> <Message ID>`  
Example: `;q a 1 553582103464378368`

__Shortcut: To mark your own question as answered__
